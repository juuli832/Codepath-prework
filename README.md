## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Candy Crush 
    Fun Colors
    Sounds
Flappy Bird
    Single tap feature
    Sounds 
    Score display 
Color sort
    Skin options 
    Podium 
    
    I would love to remake flappy bird and allow for users to choose thier own skins. I loved the simplicity of the 
    app but wished it was customizable in terms of visuals. Like even a background change or even being able to choose 
    from different birds or animals. As you progressed having harder obstables would be fun such as rain or strong winds. 
    Things that can happen in nature that would deter a bird from being able to properly fly.
